	<h1 class=gold>What is this website about?</h1>
	<div>
		This website is meant to be a personal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript "playground" of sorts. There's not that much to it.<br>
		Feel free to reuse any part of this site's code, no credit to me necessary. Just be warned that I'm still learning, so I may be using some outdated or sloppy practices without even knowing it.<br>
		That being said, this site will be updated often in the near future, so maybe I'll make something worth seeing. Don't get your hopes up, though. ;)<br>
