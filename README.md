# jk314159.github.io, a.k.a. "My Website is Terrible"
Some kind of ridiculous HTML/CSS/JS playground. None of it makes sense.

&nbsp;

## Nonplussed face
**With JS:** Outputs "*x* spooky *y* me," where *x* is a random number from 1 to 8, and *y* is *x*+2.

**Without JS:** Replaces the numbers with "x" and "y".

&nbsp;

## Crouton
A series of pages featuring a small image of a crouton. Clicking the correct crouton links you to the next page.

**With JS:** The croutons bob up and down slightly, and occasionally move around.

&nbsp;

## 1990s-looking page / "Download Now!"
A series of pages parodying the style of old webpages from the late 1990s and early 2000s. As such, it does not use an external stylesheet, and uses CSS animations to simulate the deprecated HTML "blink" tag, among other things.

Clicking the large banner leads to a page written in broken English that claims to steal "secret internet codes" (i.e. randomly generated alphanumeric characters).

**With JS:** The "secret internet codes" appear at the bottom of the page.

The smaller "Download" button at the bottom of the page links to a ZIP archive of the GitHub repo. The drop-down boxes do nothing.

&nbsp;

## Finals Calculator
**With JS:** A calculator of how well you have to do on a final exam to get a certain grade.

The image of the dancing pig links to "Best Face 2k15".

### Best Face 2k15
A colored ASCII-art image of one of my friends making a weird face.

**With JS:** From there, clicking on the "Click me!" button creates three pop-up windows that jitter around the screen (if pop-ups are allowed).

&nbsp;

## JonTron Quote Picker
**With JS:** Picks a random [JonTron](http://www.youtube.com/user/JonTronShow) quote from a list. Some quotes link to their own YouTube videos. Quotes may contain strong language.

&nbsp;

## HTML5 Canvas Testing
**With JS:** Displays an image of a Windows 98-style desktop. Upon clicking, a window will move to the cursor's position.
