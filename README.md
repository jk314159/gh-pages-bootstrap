# jk314159.github.io, a.k.a. "My Website is Terrible"
Some kind of ridiculous HTML/CSS/JS playground.

&nbsp;

## Nonplussed face
**With JS:** Outputs "*x* spooky *y* me," where *x* is a random number from 1 to 8, and *y* is *x*+2.

**Without JS:** Replaces the numbers with "x" and "y".

&nbsp;

## Crouton
A series of pages featuring a small image of a crouton. Clicking on the correct crouton links you to the next page.

**With JS:** The croutons bob up and down slightly, and occasionally move around.

&nbsp;

## 1990s-looking page / "Download Now!"
A series of pages parodying the style of old webpages from the late 1990s and early 2000s. As such, it does not use an external stylesheet, and uses CSS animations to simulate the deprecated HTML "blink" tag. Clicking the large banner leads to a page that claims to steal "secret internet codes" (i.e. randomly generated characters).

**With JS:** The "secret internet codes" appear at the bottom of the page.

Clicking the smaller "Download" button below the banner links to a ZIP of the GitHub repo. The drop-down boxes do nothing.
